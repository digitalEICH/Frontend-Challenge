# Frontend Challenge: CRUD Operations Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the Frontend Challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your ability to build an advanced CRUD operations dashboard using **Next.js**, **Shadcn UI**, **NextAuth.js**, and **Zustand**. Your mission? Create an intuitive and engaging dashboard with your **own design**, where users can manage products with advanced features like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.

## 📌 Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (frontend framework)
- **Shadcn UI** (for the design of system components and modern UI)
- **NextAuth.js** (for authentication)
- **Zustand** (for global state management)
- **Axios** (for API calls and manage requests)
- **Zod** (optional but recommended for form validation)

## ✨ Features to Implement

### 🔑 Authentication
#### Login Page:
- Users can log in using email and password.
- Use **NextAuth.js** for authentication.
- Redirect users to the dashboard after a successful login.
- Handle authentication errors gracefully.

### 📊 Dashboard
#### Products Page:
- Display a table of products with the following columns of the API docs:
- Actions (**Edit, Delete, View Details**)
- Add **search functionality** by product name.
- Add **hover effects** and interactive elements to make the table engaging.

### ➕ Add Product:
- A button to open a modal for adding a new product.
- The form should include fields in API docs:
- Validate the form inputs before submission.

### ✏️ Edit Product:
- Clicking the **Edit** button should open a modal with the product details pre-filled.
- Allow users to update the product details.
- Validate the form inputs before submission.

### 🗑️ Delete Product:
- Clicking the **Delete** button should show a confirmation dialog.
- Delete the product after confirmation.

### 🔍 View Product Details:
- Clicking the **View Details** button should open a modal with detailed information about the product.

## 🔗 API Endpoints
Since this is a frontend-only challenge, you can mock the API endpoints using fack API like  **https://fakeapi.platzi.com/**.

## 🎯 Submission Guidelines
1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repository**.
2. Deploy your code on **Vercel** and provide a **live demo**.
3. Ensure your code is **well-structured, clean, and documented**.

## 🚀 Bonus Points
- ✅ Use **TypeScript** for type safety and better code quality.
- ✅ Implement **Axios Interceptors** for handling API errors globally.
- ✅ Use **React Query** for managing API states (**loading, error, success**).
- ✅ Write **reusable components** (e.g., a reusable table component).
- ✅ Follow **SOLID principles** in your code structure.
- ✅ Organize the code into a **scalable file structure**.
- ✅ Use **GitHub branches** for different features.

## ⏳ Time Limit
This challenge is estimated to take about **6 hours** of actual work, but you have **2 days** to complete and submit it. If you need additional time, feel free to contact us.
